Overview
========

``sniffer`` is a autotest tool for Python_ using the nosetest_ library.

**NEW**: sniffer can now be customize to run anything, see 'Advanced Usage'.

Sniffer will automatically re-run tests if your code changes. And with another third-party
library (see below), the CPU usage of file system monitoring is reduced in comparison
to pure-python solutions. However, sniffer will still work without any of those libraries.
